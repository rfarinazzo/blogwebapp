# This is a Blog Web App in node.js

It was developed as a capstone project for Udemy's [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)

By this time of the bootcamp, we haven't learned anything about Deploy, Database or Authentication.

That's why this web app only runs locally using `nodemon index.js`, its blog posts are all saved as .txt files and the security for creating, editing and deleting posts is very rudimentary.

Still, it was fun to do it. :)
